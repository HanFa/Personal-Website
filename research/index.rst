I have a one-year and a half experience as an undergraduate research assistant. 
My main research interests are mobile network and operating systems.


Edge Cloud Research
-----

Mentored by Joseph Lee, I modified a vehicular lane departure warning system into a remote and parallel server-client model. 
The remote server calculates the contours, curvatures, and off-center of lanes in parallel threads.
Its performance had been studied under different network conditions. 

My later research focuses on the benefits of maintaining states for edge computing applications and claims the importance of data migration between edge servers. 
I built two versions of face classifying application for video streams: 
one maintains states and updates models by reinforcement learning. The other one uses a pre-trained static model on contrast.
As a result, the stateful version has much better prediction confidence than the stateless version. 
The research concludes an advantage of keeping user states around edge servers.

Stack-Structured L-Tage 
------

I conducted my first research with Prof. Ronald Dreslinksi and lab mates in CADRE group. 
It was about simulating a new stacked-structured L-Tage branch predictor using the gem5 simulator.
I was responsible for implementing the new architecture design by writing C++ source code as a gem5 module and benchmarking its performance using SPEC2006.
